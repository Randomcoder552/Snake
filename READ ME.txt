Hello! And thank You for taking the time to
look at My Snake Game! As mentioned in
the description of this Project, this is a basic
game that I coded in Java and using the
free Eclipse I.E.D.
If you'd like to see the source code from this
project, that I have also included that along
side the Snake.exe Application, so if you have
any experience with Java, or even if you'd
just like to take a look at it for fun, feel free
to peek at my undoubtly terribly written
code.
I would also like to mention that although
all of the code relating to logic and actaully
making the game work is mine, since I am
such a novice yet, I do follow a basic tutorial
series on Youtube that covers how to properly
initilize Jframes and many other basic 
components of a Game in Java. The channel
that uploaded these videos can be found
here if You'd like to check them out:

With all of that out of the way, thank you
again for taking the time to look at my 
Project, and I hope you enjoy the game,
even as basic as it is.
